# Graphical Modeling for HAPI
This is the repository for the projects on graphical modeling for HAPI


We implement the experiments using the base Python package "[causallearn](https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn/tree/main/causallearn/utils)"
How to run the codes:
1. Install the package "causallearn" in Python.
2. Replace the original "cit.py" file in the package with the new file in this repository;
3. Run "maggic.R" in R to generate synthetic datasets;
4. Run "mag_val.py". 

cit.py: new file for conditional independence test, including predictive permutative conditional independence test implementation.
